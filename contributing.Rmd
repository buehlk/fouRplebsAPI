# Contributing to fouRplebsAPI

## Opening issues

The easiest way to note any behavioural curiosities or to request any new
features is by opening a [github
issue](https://github.com/buehlk/fouRplebsAPI/issues).


## Development guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes to `fouRplebsAPI`, we use [the GitHub
flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for proposing,
submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. If you haven't done this before,
there's a nice [overview of git](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html), as well
as [best practices for submitting pull requests](http://r-pkgs.org/git.html#pr-make)
in the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.
